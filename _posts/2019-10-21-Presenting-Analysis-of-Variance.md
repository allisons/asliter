My closest friends, my co-workers and anyone who has seen my talk on Data Presentation knows my thoughts on presentation structure.  Inverted Pyramid > Hero's Journey.  But last September, I had the occasion to be shown an instructive counter example.

I was hiking in the Gifford Pinchot with my husband when I found the following sign.

!["Research Works for better management"](/assets/img/firstsign.jpg)

If you can't read it, it says 

>"Research works for better management.  In 1925, this study of tree growth began. Its purpose is to test the relationship of space to Douglas Fir growth and survival.
>Allow 20 minutes to walk a loop trail to see the results yourself."

I immediately heard the call to adventure and had to cross the threshold from the road into a data analysis at scale.

The experiment itself must have been relatively innovative.  Ronald Fisher had only started at Rothamsted Experiment Station 6 years before to analyze the "Classical Field Experiments" that set up separate plots and varied fertilizer treatments to systematically evaluate their effect on yields.  Modern agriculture was all the rage.  Gifford Pinchot himself was an early advocate for scientific forestry management to optimize forest product yields.

The Forest Service was established in 1905.  Population was growing rapidly, forestry products were considered crucial to everyone and 70% of productive forest lands were already in private hands.  But what's interesting is that publicly owned forest lands prior to 1905 were under the purview of the Department of the Interior (think parks and conservation) but the Forest Service was established as a part of the Department of Agriculture (think technocrats and crop yields).  Hence plot experiments in the middle of the forest.  But also, you know, forestry policy through out the 20th century.

Features of good data presentation: Annotation is close to data! (Even if the sign had seen better days)

The trees are skinny and close together.  The forest floor is littered.  I've done a fair bit of hiking in the PNW - this is just what it looks like most of the time.  So I kept walking.

As I came around a bend in the trail, I saw this:

!["Trees grown at a 10ft by 10ft spacing grid"](/assets/img/initial_space_10x10.jpg)

It's tidier, brighter, the trees are taller.  More sky is visible between them if you look up. The trees themselves dont come as closer to the trail.  And if that's not enough evidence of a health forest:

While I was staring at canopies and taking photospheres, my husband was scouring the forest floor.  He ended up coming home with 4lbs of chanterelles that day.  But only in the parts of the experiment with higher tree spacing.

And then the conclusion!

>SPACING INFLUENCES TREE GROWTH

>The Douglas fir around you are the same age - only the spacing is varied. Trees with 4'x4' spacing show student growth and winter breakage.  Trees in the 10'x10' spacing show better growth and resistance to breakage.


A quick note about agricultural experimentation and late 19th century, early 20th century modernism: Ronald Fisher was a Eugenicist. Many scientists of his day were: seeing a link between varying agricultural inputs and outputs to human inputs and outputs.  I bring it up only because I saw this sign about a quarter mile up the forest road from the tree spacing experiment:

![](/assets/img/pine2.jpg)

>GEOGRAPHIC RACES OF PONDEROSA PINE

>This study of Ponderosa pine grown from seed collected in 10 areas of the western US was begun in 1925 to study genetic differences between pine races.
>A native Ponderosa pine of similar age across the road is taller than any of the study trees, demonstrated in the superiority of local races.

This is a reminder to those of us who do analysis on human beings of how easy it is to slip in to dehumanization.  People are not trees.  And trees don't have race.  And being able to grow tallest in your native environment doesn't make you superior to people who come from far away and have to thrive in an environment they're not used to.
