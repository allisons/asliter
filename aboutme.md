subtitle: In the history of all the things you know how to do, there was a time that you didn't know how to do them.

I'm a data scientist, a linguistics enthusiast,  a nerd, a mom, a knitter, a serial hobby-abandoner, a [PyData meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-PDX) organizer, and a podcast fanatic.  I'm a skeptic but I try not to be mean about it. I want to know all of the things and help all of the people understand all of the things.  

Please contact me with any of the following:
- gluten free recipes.
- pictures of your WIP knitting projects 
- a thing you know that I don't.
- a thing you don't understand but think that I might.
- recommendations or requests of recommendations for genre fiction.
- really suprising data findings.
- if you need help with really anything.  I'll do what I can.
